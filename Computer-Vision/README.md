### ðŸ”¹ **Demo Project**
- **[Demo-Project-WaveControl](https://github.com/RuthvikaMuchala/WaveControl---Hands-free-Windows-Navigation)**  
  Added as a **Git submodule**, this project demonstrates **hands-free Windows navigation using computer vision and gesture recognition**.


## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Clone this repository with submodules:
    ```bash
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/ayushmaanFCB/AI-ML-Notes-and-Implementations.git
    ```

2. Or if already cloned:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```
    
3. Before running the notebooks, make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required dependencies using:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pillow numpy matplotlib
    ```
    
4. Open and run any notebook in Jupyter.
